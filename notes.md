>   * Help you avoid breaking things
>
> ### Before demo
> * Describe what we'll do (demo then you follow along)
> * Questions as we go ~~at the end~~

>
> ### Demo
> * Post steps in chat
> * Screen share during explanations
>   * Fullscreen to avoid cursor issue
>   * Go slower (slower than that)

> * Mention stash adding happens as a whole not individual lessons
> * Describe in detail during demo (e.g. 'green button with a plus on it')
>   * Assume people aren't watching your screen
> * They don't have to know Markdown!
> * If things go wrong, the 'discard all changes' or refreshing the page usually fixes it!

> > If someone is struggling **ask them** if they're comfortable sharing their screen with everyone
> > * If they're not - breakout room and share screen there
> {: .callout}

> >
> > Remember - **we want this complete by the end of the day because _we don't want homework_**
