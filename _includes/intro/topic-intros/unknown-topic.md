Open Research training aims to helps researchers produce practical changes to their everyday workflow to make their research more open, transparent, and robust.
Posting your research as preprints is a quick and cheap way to publish open access, and allow you to get your work out there as soon as its ready.
This Train-the-Trainer course will support researchers who are practiced in posting preprints in helping their colleagues to integrate preprinting into their existing workflow.

The key components of the UKRN Open Research Training ethos are:
<details>
  <summary>Researchers teaching researchers</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Researchers know the ins and outs of how open research practices work in their field, and they can offer specific, practical guidance to colleagues.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>No homework</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Researchers are busy, so we aim to have the result of the training - a workshop to deliver or an adjusted workflow - in place by the end of the training.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary title="...and good is better!">Better is good</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We want to encourage researchers to do a little more to make their research open, transparent, and robust; we're not trying to admonish researchers for falling short of perfect.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Building connections</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We want to connect researchers keen on open research practices across disciplines and institutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We want to connect researchers with existing support, especially library services, who can assist with many open research practices.
    </li>
  </ul>

This short course will equip you with a workshop, similar in style to this one but with bespoke content customised and tweaked by you.
We'll provide some inspiration about ways to engage your colleagues, and some tips on how to run a successful workshop.
We'll teach you how to use our Workshop Builder Tool and Open Research Resource Browser, and then we'll turn you loose with them to create your own workshop.

We'll be right here the whole time to answer questions, discuss ideas, and solve any technical issues.
