We now have a chance to actually build a workshop.
We are not aiming for a template or for notes that we're expecting you to develop on your own time - we want to produce a workshop right now that you could deliver tomorrow morning.

You have your workshop plan from the <a href="{{ site.ukrn_or_template }}" target="_blank">template</a>.
Now you can build that plan into a workshop using the <a href="{{ site.ukrn_or_builder }}" target="_blank">Workshop Builder Tool</a> and <a href="{{ site.ukrn_or_browser }}" target="_blank">Open Research Resources Browser</a>.
If you prefer, you can create your workshop using other tools, of course - the important thing is to get it done!

> ## Remember:
> * The focus is on producing practical changes
> * Don't give out homework
> * What do they need to understand to implement workflow changes?

> ## We're here to help
> Ask us if you get stuck, or just want to talk something over.
>
> You can ask questions in the chat, or ask one of us out loud.
> Everyone else can ignore the chat/conversation and get on with creating a workshop while it's all going smoothly.

We'll have a break in 90 minutes and take stock of how everyone's getting on.
