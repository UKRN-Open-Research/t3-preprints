## UKRN Open Research Training

You're here to get involved in helping your colleagues share their data.
Increasing data sharing is part of the UKRN mission to improve the openness and robustness of research.
We can help you put together a workshop which will make it easier to achieve real changes in your colleagues' behaviour, and you can bring your specialist knowledge and experience.

> ## Approach
> * **Practical workflow change**: we want to produce actual changes to how people work by tweaking their default workflow
> * **No homework** for busy researchers (including you!)
> * **Better is good** - we want everyone doing something a bit better by the end
{: .callout}

### Course structure

Today we'll be giving you some tips on how to deliver workshops, courtesy of our guest-presenter Louise from Bristol Institute of Teaching and Learning, followed by an introduction to our Workshop Builder Tool and our Resource List.
At the end, there will be a large block of time for you to use the Workshop Builder Tool (or something else if you prefer) to build your own workshop to deliver to your colleagues.

> ## What you'll get out of this course
> * A Workshop website you can use to help your colleagues with sharing data
> * Some ideas for how to engage colleagues and manage the workshop
> * Membership of an enthusiastic community of like-minded researchers in various disciplines

### Data sharing

Data sharing means something a bit different in practice to all of you - that's why we can't just produce a one-size-fits-all guide and be done with it!

> ## Discussion `5 min`
> What does data sharing mean for you?

> What are you hoping your colleagues will know by the end of your workshops?
